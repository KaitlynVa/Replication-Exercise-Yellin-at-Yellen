# Replication Materials: "'Yellin' at Yellen': Hostile Sexism in the Federal Reserve Congressional Hearings"
Kaitlyn Vana, Jiani Zhao

Replication materials for James Bisbee, Nicolo Fraccaroli, and Andreas Kern "Yellin' at Yellen,"

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> 
How prevalent is hostile sexism among US politicians? We analyze the transcripts of every congressional hearing attended by the chair of the US Federal Reserve from 2001 to 2020 using Janet Yellen as a bundled treatment to provide carefully identified evidence of sexism. We find that legislators who interacted with both Yellen and at least one other male Fed chair over this period interrupt Yellen more and interact with her using more aggressive language. Furthermore, we show that having a daughter reduces a legislator’s hostility toward Yellen. These results are not a function of differences in either the content Yellen discusses in these hearings (measured with topic models) or her tone of communication. Our results provide carefully identified evidence of hostile sexism among both male and female legislators from both sides of the aisle when confronted with a female in a novel position of power, supporting a rich literature on gender roles and forms of sexism.</p>

# Tutorial
This README file provides an overview of the replications materials for the article. The R codes used in the article can be found under the folder codes. The cleaned and prepped texts files that allow for replication is under the folder data. All the images for the main paper are available at the folder output

If other researchers are interested in the processed datasets or raw text files, you can find them <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/N2XICI">here</a>.

The codes below begin from prepped datasets. Beginning from the raw text files was beyond our capacity. We also do not replicate all figures found in the original paper, but we do fully replicate the results.
